\chapter{Timbre}

\section{Intro}
	\note{Timbre is whack yo!}

\section{Defining Timbre}
	\note{What is timbre?}

\section{Audio Features}
	\note{Bits and bobs about the audio features used in MIR and stuff.}

\section{Parameterisation of Timbre}
	\note{Analysis of timbre spaces and discussion on salience of some features as given in the literature.}

	\subsection{Dissimilarity Tests}
		\note{A more traditional approach, Grey and all the copycat lot.}

	\subsection{VAME}
		\note{Kendall and Carterette trying to upset the status quo.}

	\subsection{Parameter Space}
		\note{Research like Social EQ and stuff.}

\section{Controlling Timbre}
	\note{Lots of them synthesis dudes have tried to control the beast. Zacharakis has done some shit.}
	
	\note{Some dudes do morphing (analysis resynthesis from what I remember) like good old Williams and Brookes.}
