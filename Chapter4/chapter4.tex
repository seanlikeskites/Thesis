%Suitability of Exciters for Perceptual Control
%	Good features of a timbral control algorithm.
%		Consistent effect across amplitudes (DAFx paper)
%		Flexibility of single harmonic control (SMC paper)
%	Parameterise feature changes in terms of harmonic excitation.
%	Most suitable methods for given feature manipulations.
%	Easiest features to control in isolation.
