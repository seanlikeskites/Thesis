%Suitability of Exciters for Perceptual Control
%	Good features of a timbral control algorithm.
%		Consistent effect across amplitudes (DAFx paper)
%		Flexibility of single harmonic control (SMC paper)
%	Parameterise feature changes in terms of harmonic excitation.
%	Most suitable methods for given feature manipulations.
%	Easiest features to control in isolation.

\section{Desirable Features for Perceptual Control}
	\note{Consistent effects across amplitudes a la DAFx paper.
	      Flexibility introduced by allowing single harmonic control a la SMC paper}

\section{Parameterisation of Feature Changes}
	\todo{This needs doing}

\section{Controlling features with Exciters}
	\todo{Should fall out of the previous section}
