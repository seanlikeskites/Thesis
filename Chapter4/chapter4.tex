\chapter{Suitability of Exciters for Perceptual Control}
\label{chap:FeatureControl}

	In order to aid in the intuitiveness of an audio effect it should produce a similar perceptual effect across a wide range of input signals. This is not the case with traditional audio signal processing methods. Take the EQ for example. We can set up an EQ to boost some frequencies in a desired range. A problem arises where we process signals which have no energy in this frequency range. For some signals there will be a noticeable change in the spectral characteristics, but other signals will remain unchanged.

	This problem is compounded when the audio processing in nonlinear. As well as different signals producing different perceptual effect, now the same signal at different levels might produce different perceptual effects. A simple example of this is a peak clipping effect. If a signal's amplitude is above the clipping threshold there will be a noticeable effect. This signal will be unaffected however, if its amplitude falls below the threshold.

	The field of adaptive audio effects looks to solve some of these issues by producing effect which analyses the input signal and adjust their parameters accordingly \note{[site some stuff up]}.

	As discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:Timbre} previous studies have attempted to control perceptual features by controlling specific audio features. This chapter will identify the audio features which can be controlled through harmonic excitation and which excitation algorithms are the most suitable for given feature changes.

	Several harmonic excitation methods were discussed in Section \ref{sec:Excitation-Methods}. When applied to the task of controlling specific audio features each of these methods has its own advantages and disadvantages.
