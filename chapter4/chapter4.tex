%Suitability of Exciters for Perceptual Control
%	Parameterise feature changes in terms of harmonic excitation.
%	Most suitable methods for given feature manipulations.
%	Easiest features to control in isolation.

\chapter{Suitability of Exciters for Perceptual Control} % control of low level features using exciters
\label{chap:FeatureControl}
	As discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:Timbre} previous studies have attempted to control perceptual features by 
	controlling specific audio features. This chapter will identify the audio features which can be controlled through 
	harmonic excitation and which excitation algorithms are the most suitable for given feature changes.
