Review of timbral control research.
	Audio Features
	Perceptual Control of Synthesis

Review of which audio features can be controlled by harmonic excitation.
	Parameterise feature changes in terms of harmonic excitation.
	Most suitable methods for given feature manipulations.
	Easiest features to control in isolation.
	Good features of a timbral control algorithm (uniform behaviour across dynamic range etc.)

Discuss timbral control possibilities from feature manipulations.
	SAFE data.
	Social EQ data (weighting functions can give a good judge of feature manipulation).
