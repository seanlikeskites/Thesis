Some Intro Bollocks

Review of timbral control research.
	Timbre Definition
	Timbre Spaces (MDS and shit)
	Audio Features
	Perceptual Control of Synthesis

Review of existing harmonic excitation.
	Nonlinear Systems
		Traditional Metrics (THD, IMD)
		Minimisation of Nonlinear Distortion
		Advent of "Nonlinear Niceness"
	Timbre of nonlinear distortions (Martens and Marui type shit)
	Uses of Harmonic Excitation
	Harmonic Generation Methods
		Static Nonlinearities
		Bandwidth Extension (high frequency reconstruction)
		Individual Harmonic Generation (SMC paper)
		Psychoacoustic Enhancers

Suitability of Exciters for Perceptual Control
	Good features of a timbral control algorithm.
		Consistent effect across amplitudes (DAFx paper)
		Flexibility of single harmonic control (SMC paper)
	Parameterise feature changes in terms of harmonic excitation.
	Most suitable methods for given feature manipulations.
	Easiest features to control in isolation.

Discuss timbral control possibilities from feature manipulations.
	SAFE data.
	Social EQ data (weighting functions can give a good judge of feature manipulation).
