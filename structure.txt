Timbral Control of Audio Through Harmonic Excitation

Chapter 1
Some Intro stuff

Chapter 2
Review of timbral control research.
	Timbre Definition
	Timbre Spaces (MDS and stuff)
	Audio Features
	Perceptual Control of Synthesis

Chapter 3
Review of existing harmonic excitation.
	Nonlinear Systems
		Traditional Metrics (THD, IMD)
		Minimisation of Nonlinear Distortion
		Advent of "Nonlinear Niceness"
	Timbre of nonlinear distortions (Martens and Marui type stuff)
	Uses of Harmonic Excitation
	Harmonic Generation Methods
		Static Nonlinearities
		Bandwidth Extension (high frequency reconstruction)
		Individual Harmonic Generation (SMC paper)
		Psychoacoustic Enhancers

Chapter 4
Suitability of Exciters for Perceptual Control
	Good features of a timbral control algorithm.
		Consistent effect across amplitudes (DAFx paper)
		Flexibility of single harmonic control (SMC paper)
	Parameterise feature changes in terms of harmonic excitation.
	Most suitable methods for given feature manipulations.
	Easiest features to control in isolation.

	// Derive some salient audio features from the methods. Features which can separate excited audio from otherwise processed audio.

// New chapter in here, SAFE was made to test this salience with real world data. Because VAME and Mushra are too limited.

Chapter 5
Discuss timbral control possibilities from feature manipulations.
	SAFE data.
	Social EQ data (weighting functions can give a good judge of feature manipulation).

	// What semantic terms can be controlled by the features given in chapter 4.

// Another chapter on the end to confirm the success of the research. Make a new effect which will do the control through harmonic excitation and do some evaluation tests with people.
