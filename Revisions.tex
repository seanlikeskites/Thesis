		\hline 
		\bf{Revision} & \bf{Action Taken} \tabularnewline
		\hline
		Review the abstract to ensure that the contribution to knowledge is more explicit & \tabularnewline
		\hline
		Review the acronym list for completeness & Entries for ADSR, AMDF, API, AU, EQ, ERB, HPS, LFO, MUSHRA, RDF,
			SAFE and VST added to the acronym list \tabularnewline
		\hline
		The mathematical notation list lacks Mahalanobis distance & \tabularnewline
		\hline
		In Chapter 1 add flowchart of key stages of audio development process & \tabularnewline
		\hline
		Add PCA equation on p26 & \tabularnewline
		\hline
		Fig 5.12 should be moved to the appropriate place in Chapter 3 & Figure moved to Section~3.5.8 and
			accompanying text in that section altered. Relevant text in the spectral folding subsection of
			Section~5.2.4 also altered. \tabularnewline
		\hline
		Amend axis labelling on Figs 3.4. 3.5 and the former Fig 5.12 to add correct frequency figures &
			Figures~3.4 to 3.6 now have frequency axis labels at 0 and $\frac{f_{s}}{2}$ \tabularnewline
		\hline
		In s4.2.2, adjust motivation for plugins & \tabularnewline
		\hline
		In s4.2.3, add justification for 5-second plugin sample size & \tabularnewline
		\hline
		On pp68-70, explain how much variance is explained by principal components & \tabularnewline
		\hline
		On the plots with principal components in Chapter 4, ensure that numbering on axes is complete &
			\tabularnewline
		\hline
		In chapter 4, explain what happens to PC4 and PC5 & \tabularnewline
		\hline
		On p96 equation 5.13, the derivation for integrator for series should be included (eg in an Appendix as
			discussed below) & Derivation of Fourier series coefficients given in Appendix~A.2.
			Derivation of the Fourier series for full wave rectification (Equation~5.11) also
			included as Appendix~A.1 for completeness. References added to the text in the
			relevant sections, linking to the appendices. \tabularnewline
		\hline
		Figs 5.8-5.11 and 5.14 need replotting for greater clarity & Unprocessed signal moved to its
			own figure (Figure~5.8), the processed signals for the multiplier, SSBA and IAP techniques then
			shown on their own in Figures~5.9 to 5.12. Spectra of signal processed by STTR split into
			subfigures in Figure~5.14 \tabularnewline
		\hline
		On p99, the description of IAP should mention and reference its relationship to complex FM synthesis &
			\tabularnewline
		\hline
		s5.2.5 should mention the square wave appearance of the signal & \tabularnewline
		\hline
		On p100, correct the cutoff frequency reference at top of page & Expression corrected to
			$\left( \frac{f_{2}}{2} - f \right)$Hz. \tabularnewline
		\hline
		In Chapter 6, ensure complete descriptions of the filters used are given (eg in an Appendix as discussed
			below) & \tabularnewline
		\hline
		On p118, place a methodology discussion within the dedicated evaluation methodology section and describe and
			justify test signals used in the final paragraph & \tabularnewline
		\hline
		On p125, give full derivation of equation 6.6 (eg in an Appendix as discussed below) &
			Derivation of spectral flatness parameterisation given in Appendix~A.3. Reference to that appendix
			added to the text. \tabularnewline
		\hline
		Be consistent in use of tristimulus/tristimuli & \tabularnewline
		\hline
		Table 6.1 (p135) should be moved to s6.3 & Table moved to its own section (Section~6.3.1).
			Second paragraph in the conclusion section of Chapter~6 adjusted accordingly. \tabularnewline
		\hline
		The first 2 sentences of Chapter 7 can be deleted & Deleted those two sentences. \tabularnewline
		\hline
		Expand the second paragraph of Chapter 7 to explain the experimental methodology used & \tabularnewline
		\hline
		In s7.2.2, insert a flow diagram to clearly explain operation of synthesis systems & \tabularnewline
		\hline
		Explain the colour coding, and increase the size of, Figs 7.4 and 7.6 & Figure size increased
			and the text of the first paragraph in the Subjective Evaluation subsection of Section~7.2.2
			amended to explain the use of colour. \tabularnewline
		\hline
		In s7.3.4, clarify and explain the derivation of percentages and their relationship with heat maps &
			\tabularnewline
		\hline
		In s8.4.2, improve the clarity of the second paragraph to deal separately with monotonic and polyphonic
			signals, perhaps as 2 paragraphs & \tabularnewline
		\hline
		The section on further work needs to identify future work directly emerging from the thesis &
			\tabularnewline
		\hline
		Throughout, review the use of `conclusion', `conclusions' and `summary', particularly at the end of each
			chapter & \tabularnewline
		\hline
		Provide a new Appendix to list software contributions and tools used & \tabularnewline
		\hline
		Carry out a final proof read of the revised text & \tabularnewline
