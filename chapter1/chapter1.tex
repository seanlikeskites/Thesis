		harmonic excitation. Distortion is typically applied to guitar signals.

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:Introduction-Motivation}
% Genuine Waffle (if those who disagree have uncovered this comment I have no regrets)
	Traditional audio effects evolved from the use of analogue signal processing systems designed to address the
	technical requirements of broadcast or recording. As such, these effects have control parameters which relate
	directly to specific technical properties of an audio signal: a traditional equaliser has parameters for selecting
	specific frequency regions, traditional dynamics processors (compressors and limiters) have parameters relating to
	signal amplitudes. These parameters are effective when correcting technical issues with a signal but do not allow
	for intuitive creative manipulation of timbre.

	The application of audio effects for creative purposes is typically motivated by the perceived timbre of the audio.
	Creative decisions are often expressed using language which does not refer to the mathematical properties of the
	recorded signals. For example one might ask that the saxophone is made more present in the mix, or that the piano be
	made to sound more airy. In order to complete these tasks using traditional audio effects, music producers and audio
	engineers require knowledge of how the technical parameters relate to specific perceived aspects of timbre. This
	knowledge is gained through training and experience, presenting an obstacle to novices.

	Audio production software typically uses parameter presets to assist novice users. These are a predefined set of
	parameter values for a particular effect which are labelled with semantic descriptions. Users can apply an effect to
	a signal and choose a preset which best fits their desired outcome. This does not, however, provide an intuitive
	interface to the user. A static parameter setting will not apply the same timbral transformation to all input
	signals. If the user wishes to alter the settings slightly, they still require knowledge of how the effect's
	parameters relate to perceived timbre. For example, a user might apply a preset to make a sound brighter, if they
	are not happy with the result no assistance is given in making the sound more or less bright.

	More intuitive interfaces for control over timbre provide parameters which directly relate to perceived aspects of a
	sound. These perform the translation between the language used to describe timbre and the technical parameters of
	signal processing algorithms, allowing users to focus on the creative aspects of music production. Having timbral
	properties controlled by continuous parameters increases the intuitiveness of the system as it is evident which
	parameter to adjust to change a particular timbral property. The effect can also analyse the input signal and adjust
	itself such that the parameter has similar timbral effects across a wide range of inputs. Developing this type of
	semantically controlled effect requires study of how the mathematical properties of a signal contribute to its
	perceived timbre. Effects can then be built which manipulate these signal properties according to the value of a
	semantically labelled parameter. Making audio effects more intuitive in this manner aids both novice and experienced
	music produces and audio engineers. Novices benefit from the reduced amount of knowledge needed to apply audio
	effects; being able to select and adjust effects based on natural language descriptions of timbre rather than
	requiring a technical knowledge of signal processing. For experienced users these effects can be used to accelerate
	the production process; reducing the work required to configure audio effect parameters, allowing users to focus on
	creative decisions. 
	
	Commercial audio effects with semantically labelled parameters have been available for a number of years, for
	example the OneKnob series of effects produced by \citet{wavesoneknob}. Being commercial products the operation of
	these effects is not known, but it is assumed that they were developed alongside input from professional audio
	engineers. In academic research a number of studies have been undertaken in developing these types of control
	systems for synthesis and audio processing application (discussed in Section~\ref{sec:Timbre-Control}). This work
	focusses on how this type of system can be built using nonlinear distortion / excitation effects.

\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:Introduction-Objectives}
	The underlying objective of this thesis is to produce intuitive timbre shaping effects based on harmonic excitation
	algorithms (systems which introduce new harmonic partials to a signal). This is achieved through answering the
	following questions:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item What semantic terms are commonly used to describe the timbre of harmonic excitation effects? 
		\item What properties of audio signals contribute to these timbral descriptions? Investigation of what
		      alterations are made to signals to produce a certain timbral result.
		\item What properties of audio signals can be reliably controlled by harmonic excitation algorithms?
		\item How can harmonic excitation systems be configured to control elements of timbre? Systems will be
		      proposed which allow control over particular semantic features and the accuracy of these systems
		      assessed.
	\end{itemize}

\section{Thesis Structure}
\label{sec:Introduction-ThesisStructure}
	In {\bf{Chapter~\ref{chap:Timbre}}} the background of research into timbre is discussed. It begins with a discussion
	of the low level features of audio signals. Popular experimental methodologies for uncovering the perceptual effects
	of these features are then introduced along with the methods used to analyse their results. Finally, existing work
	concerning the control of perceptual features of audio signals is discussed.

	{\bf{Chapter~\ref{chap:Excitation}}} covers the body of work concerning harmonic excitation, starting with a
	discussion of the analysis of nonlinear systems in the field of audio production. The uses of such systems and the
	their timbral effects are then presented. Finally, various algorithms for harmonic excitation, proposed in existing
	literature, are described.

	In {\bf{Chapter~\ref{chap:TimbreEvaluation}}} the collection of semantic audio data during the production process is
	discussed. This data is used to determine the language used for describing audio in a studio environment and how
	audio effects are used to produce certain timbral effects.

	In {\bf{Chapter~\ref{chap:ExcitationEvaluation}}} a set of criteria for assessing the applicability of harmonic
	excitation techniques to timbral control is proposed. The algorithms described in the Chapter~\ref{chap:Excitation}
	are then evaluated against these criteria to identify those most suitable for use in timbral control systems.
	Methods by which the performance of certain harmonic excitation methods can be improved are proposed.

	In {\bf{Chapter~\ref{chap:FeatureControl}}} results from Chapters \ref{chap:TimbreEvaluation} and
	\ref{chap:ExcitationEvaluation} are used to inform the design of systems for controlling low level features using
	harmonic excitation techniques.

	In {\bf{Chapter~\ref{chap:PerceptualExperiments}}} perceptual effects of the systems proposed in
	Chapter~\ref{chap:FeatureControl} are evaluated.
