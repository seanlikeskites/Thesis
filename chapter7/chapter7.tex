\chapter{Validation of Timbral Models}
\label{chap:PerceptualExperiments}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:PerceptualExperiments-Introduction}
	Controlling the perceived timbre of audio signals using traditional music production tools is a non-trivial task.
	Music producers must identify what properties of a signal need to be changed and then use specialist knowledge to
	select the correct tools and configure them to achieve the desired result. The techniques proposed in Chapter
	\ref{chap:FeatureControl} provide monotonic control over specific audio features, these can be combined with the
	acoustic correlated discovered in Chapter \ref{chap:TimbreEvaluation} to build intuitive effects which can be used
	without this specialist knowledge. These timbral control effects can be given perceptual control parameters
	labelled with commonly used semantic descriptors. Novice users can then select which effect to use based on the
	names of its parameters. Additionally, when using the effect, they are able to more easily make creative decisions
	without having to translate them to traditional control parameter settings.

	This chapter presents two experiments that evaluate the performance of timbral control systems proposed in this
	work. The first experiment (Section \ref{sec:PerceptualExperiments-Reconstruction}) compares the abilities of
	different excitation methods in generating individual harmonics to reconstruct degraded signals. The second
	experiment (Section \ref{sec:PerceptualExperiments-SemanticControl}) uses the results discussed in Chapter
	\ref{chap:TimbreEvaluation} to inform the design of harmonic excitation effects which provide control over a
	particular perceptual parameter.  In both experiments the performance of the systems is evaluated using both
	objective metrics and subjectively through perceptual listening tests.

	Several of the harmonic excitation systems discussed in Section \ref{sec:FeatureControl-Systems} rely on the
	generation of individual harmonics of the input signal. Ideally, when a new harmonic is added to a signal using one
	of these systems it should sound natural. The resulting signal should sound as though it came from a single source.
	A poorly generated harmonic may be perceived as a new sinusoid completely separate from the original input signal.
	Harmonic generation methods can be evaluated by how naturally they can reconstruct signals from which harmonics
	have been removed. In this section we present an experiment evaluating the performance of three different harmonic
	generation methods.

	\subsection{Harmonic Reconstruction Systems}
	\label{sec:PerceptualExperiments-Reconstruction-Systems}
		Missing harmonics can be reintroduced by generating them from the information remaining in a degraded
		signal. This can be achieved using a spectral shaping system similar to that shown in Figure
		\ref{fig:SpectralShapingSystem}. Rather than shaping the spectrum to achieve a musical effect it is used to
		reconstruct the shape of the original spectrum. The missing harmonics are generated individually with the
		amplitudes they had in the original (non-degraded) signal. In this section three methods of generating
		these individual harmonics are discussed.

		The first method of reconstructing the harmonics is based on synthesis of new sinusoids and is illustrated
		in Figure \ref{fig:Synthesise}. The STFT of the input signal is calculated and used to generate an
		amplitude envelope for the input signal's $f_{0}$. This amplitude envelope is then used in the synthesis of
		a sinusoid at the frequency of the desired harmonic.

		\end{figure}

		The other two harmonic generation methods use the system illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:FilterAndShift},
		isolating the $f_{0}$ with a low pass filter and then using a frequency shifting technique to change the
		frequency to that of the desired harmonic. The two frequency shifting techniques used in this experiment
		are SSBA (Section \ref{sec:Excitation-Methods-SSBA}) and IAP (Section \ref{sec:Excitation-Methods-IAP}).

	\subsection{Methodology}
	\label{sec:PerceptualExperiments-Reconstruction-Methodology}
		\subsubsection*{Stimuli Generation}

				Degradation filter params?
			}

			The harmonic reconstruction systems were evaluated using the same four audio signals used in
			Section \ref{sec:FeatureControl-Parameterisation} to assess audio feature parameterisation
			techniques (cello, clarinet, synthesised and piano). For each signal the third through ninth
			harmonics were removed. This was in order to cause significant degradation in the quality of the
			signal such that the difference is plainly audible to the majority of listeners. The second
			harmonic was left in the signal to pose a challenge to the SSBA and IAP methods. As mentioned
			previously, the performance of these methods depends on how well the $f_{0}$ is isolated.
			Retaining the second harmonic allows for the effect of filter order on the performance of the
			system to be assessed. Spectrograms of the cello signal before and after this process are shown in
			Figures \ref{fig:CelloSpectrogram} and \ref{fig:CelloFilteredSpectrogram}. 

			\begin{figure}[h!]

				\label{fig:CelloSpectrograms}
			\end{figure}

			Test stimuli were created by reintroducing the third through ninth harmonics to the filtered
			signals using the systems described in Section
			\ref{sec:PerceptualExperiments-Reconstruction-Systems}. In order to reduce the number of variables,
			each of the unprocessed signals was analysed prior to the creation of the test stimuli. The $f_{0}$
			of each signal was measured along with the amplitudes of the third through ninth harmonics. This
			information was then used in the reconstruction of the signal, mitigating any inaccuracies which
			may be introduced by calculating it in real time and allowing the naturalness of the generated
			harmonics to be assessed more thoroughly.

			Eleven test stimuli were created from each of the original four signals. The first two being the
			unprocessed signal and the filtered signal. The remaining nine were reconstructions of the original
			signal from the filtered signal. Each signal was reconstructed three times using each system, using
			different parameters each time. For the synthesis method the window length of the STFT was changed,
			taking values of 50, 100 and 500 samples. As the window length increases the frequency resolution
			of the spectrum increases allowing for more accurate calculation of the amplitude of the $f_{0}$.
			Longer window length however will decrease the temporal resolution of the system, smoothing the
			extracted amplitude envelope. Care must be taken to not increase the STFT window length such that
			this smoothing starts to reduce the accuracy of the extracted amplitude envelope.  For the SSBA and
			IAP methods a different order FIR filter was used to isolate the $f_{0}$. The filters used were
			windowed sinc filters with orders of 50, 100 and 500 and using the Blackman window to maximise
			stopband attenuation \citep{schlichtharle2011digital}. As the filter order increases the $f_{0}$ is
			better isolated reducing the level of any intermodulation components.

		\subsubsection*{Objective Evaluation}
			An approximation of the perceptual difference between the stimuli and the relevant audio signal is
			measured using the $R_{\mathrm{nonlin}}$ metric proposed by \citet{tan2004predicting}. As discussed
			in Section \ref{sec:Excitation-Analysis-Metrics} this is a metric which uses psychoacoustic models
			of the human hearing system to judge the perceived level of distortion in a signal. It is
			calculated by comparing the degraded signal against the non-degraded signal, returning a value
			between 0 and 1. 1 denoting a signal which is indistinguishable from the original and lower values
			describing signals with a higher level of perceivable distortion.

		\subsubsection*{Subjective Evaluation}
			The performance of the reconstruction systems was evaluated subjectively using series of multiple
			stimulus listening tests using the MUSHRA methodology \citep{mushra2014}. Each test is split into
			two phases, a training phase and an evaluation phase. In the training phase, participants are
			presented with an interface (Figure \ref{fig:MushraTraining}) which allows them to audition every
			one of the stimuli. Participants are asked to listen to each of them in comparison with the
			relevant reference (the unprocessed signal) in order to learn the range of degradation present
			across stimuli. Once they have auditioned every stimulus they are able to proceed to the evaluation
			phase.

			\begin{figure}[h!]
				\centering
				\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{chapter7/Images/MushraTraining.png}
				\caption{The training phase interface.}
				\label{fig:MushraTraining}
			\end{figure}

			During the evaluation phase participants are presented with all stimuli created from the same
			signal at once. They were asked to grade how well each of the stimuli recreate the reference
			stimuli (the unprocessed signal) on a scale from 0 to 100. The scale is shown in Figure
			\ref{fig:MushraScale} and the full interface in Figure \ref{fig:MushraEvaluation}.

			\begin{figure}[h!]
				\centering
				\begin{tikzpicture}
					\draw(0, 0) -- (7.5, 0);

					\foreach \x/\xvalue in {0/0, 1.5/20, 3/40, 4.5/60, 6/80, 7.5/100}
						\draw (\x, 0pt) -- (\x, 3pt)
						(\x, 0pt) node[below] {\xvalue};

					\foreach \x/\xtext in {0.75/Bad, 2.25/Poor, 3.75/Fair, 5.25/Good, 6.75/Excellent}
						\draw (\x, 3pt) node[above] {\xtext};
				\end{tikzpicture}
				\caption{The grading scale used in the evaluation phase.}
				\label{fig:MushraScale}
			\end{figure}

			Among the stimuli to be graded were a hidden reference and anchor. These are included in order to
			assess the performance of test participants. The hidden reference is a repetition of the reference
			signal and as such should be given a grade of 100 as there is no difference between it and the
			reference. The anchor is the degraded signal and should be graded worse than the all the other
			stimuli as no attempt has been made to reconstruct the signal. If a participant does not grade the
			hidden reference and anchor in this way their results may not be reliable.

			\begin{figure}[h!]
				\centering
				\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{chapter7/Images/MushraEvaluation.png}
				\caption{The evaluation phase interface.}
				\label{fig:MushraEvaluation}
			\end{figure}

			This evaluation phase is repeated for each of the original audio signals. The order in which the
			evaluation phases for each signal were presented to participants was randomised along with the
			order in which the stimuli appear in the interface in order to mitigate any effect the order in
			which stimuli are heard may have on the results.

			Listening tests were undertaken using circumaural headphones in a quiet listening environment. In
			total eight participants took part in the listening tests, all of whom reported no know hearing
			problems. On average participants spent 5.14 minutes in the training phase ($\sigma$ = 1.85) and
			3.36 minutes on each of the four evaluation phases ($\sigma$ = 20.6).

	\subsection{Results}

		\end{tabular}

		The $R_{\mathrm{nonlin}}$ results for each of the stimuli are presented in Figure \ref{fig:SMCRNonlin}. The
		values have been normalised to the range 0 to 100 for purposes of comparison with the grading scale used in
		the listening test. Note that for the piano signal three of the reconstructed stimuli have
		$R_{\mathrm{nonlin}}$ score lower than that of the anchor. This is due to the piano signal having a damped
		$f_{0}$.  Reconstructing the higher order harmonics using information in the $f_{0}$ produces lower quality
		harmonics as the structure of the $f_{0}$ does not reflect that of the other harmonics in the signal. In
		lieu of this, test participants who grade any of the reconstructed piano stimuli less than the piano anchor
		will not be deemed unreliable.
		
		Two of the eight participants who took part in the listening tests failed to grade the hidden reference
		correctly causing their results have been discarded. The mean grades given by the remaining six
		participants are shown in Figure \ref{fig:SMCResults} with error bars illustrating 95\% confidence
		intervals. The Pearson correlation ($r$) between these mean grades and the $R_{\mathrm{nonlin}}$ scores for
		the stimuli are shown in Table \ref{tab:SMCCorrelations}.

		The results of the listening test show that the effects of STFT window length and filter order are as
		expected. Across the majority of the stimuli there is an increase in the perceived quality of the
		reconstruction as the STFT window length / filter order is increased. The $R_{\mathrm{nonlin}}$
		measurements confirm that as these parameters are increased the resulting reconstructed signal is
		objectively more similar to the original signal. For each of the original signals the reconstruction with a
		window length / filter order of 500 receive similar grades, it is in the lower setting of these parameters
		that differences between the methods become noticeable.

		For each of the acoustic signals (cello, clarinet and piano) the synthesis method with an STFT window
		length of 50 samples was given the lowest mean grade by participants. This is most likely because of the
		poor spectral resolution achieved when using such a short analysis window. The SSBA and IAP techniques
		produce better reconstructions of these signals at lower filter orders and require less computational
		power. The results for the synthesised sample do not exhibit this pattern, with the IAP reconstructions
		being given lower grades than the other methods for lower filter orders. However, examining the
		$R_{\mathrm{nonlin}}$ measures it is seen that the IAP reconstructions of this signal are objectively more
		similar to the original signal than those reconstructed with the synthesis method. This is possibly
		explained by the fact that the synthesised signal is the easiest to reconstruct. It is a purely harmonic
		signal with no energy at inharmonic frequencies. This makes it easy to isolate the $f_{0}$ and produce
		harmonics with less intermodulation components. As all the reconstructions of the synthesised signal are
		similar to each other it is more difficult for test participants to decide where to grade them on the
		scale.  Where there is more variability between the stimuli, as for the acoustic signals, it becomes easier
		for test participants to grade stimuli on the scale as they will need to be spread over a wider / larger
		range.

		\note
		{
			Link into further work, we need to model the relationships between harmonic amplitudes.
		}

		All the systems evaluated in this section use the amplitude envelope of the $f_{0}$ to inform the amplitude
		envelopes of the generated harmonics. This assumes that the amplitude envelopes of the harmonics in a
		signal have a simple relationship with that of the $f_{0}$. A linear relationship is assumed by both the
		IAP and synthesis based systems while the SSBA system assumes a polynomial relationship which is dependant
		on the order of the harmonic being generated. These assumptions introduce inaccuracies in the
		reconstruction of signals in which the amplitudes of the harmonics do not obey these relationships. Better
		results might be achieved by using one of the higher order harmonics in the generation of new harmonics,
		rather than the $f_{0}$. For the synthesis method, measuring the amplitude of this harmonic and for the
		SSBA and IAP methods filtering this harmonic out and shifting its frequency to the desired value. For the
		cello sample, for instance, it may be better to use the $f_{0}$ in the generation of the third harmonic but
		the second harmonic in the generation of the other harmonics as the amplitude envelopes of those
		combinations are better matched as seen in Figure \ref{fig:CelloSpectrogram}. Building a system like this
		however, requires knowledge of which harmonics in the input signal will be the best choice for
		reconstructing a given harmonic. This will be different depending on the source of the signal and is not
		calculable from a degraded input signal. Furthermore, the SSBA and IAP techniques are only able apply
		frequency shifts at integer multiples of the frequency of the input signal. In order to generate all orders
		of harmonic using these techniques the $f_{0}$ must be used as the input to the frequency shifter.
		
		The degree of inaccuracy introduced can be estimated by examining the relationships of the harmonics'
		amplitudes in the unprocessed test signals. As the systems rely on the amplitude envelope of the $f_{0}$
		this relationship will be measured as the ratio between the amplitude of each harmonic and that of the
		$f_{0}$ $\left(\frac{h_{n}}{h_{1}}\right)$. Depending on the source of the sound, and playing method if
		it was produced by an acoustic instrument, the relationships between the harmonics' amplitudes may be
		different in the attack, sustain and release portions of the signal. Figures \ref{fig:AttackAmplitudes} to
		\ref{fig:ReleaseAmplitudes} show the amplitude ratios between the third through ninth harmonics of the test
		signals and their $f_{0}$s.

		Figure \ref{fig:AttackAmplitudes} shows the amplitude ratios between the harmonics and $f_{0}$ for the

		followed by a slower decay in which the amplitudes of the higher harmonics decay quicker than that of the
		$f_{0}$. The synthesised signal (Figure \ref{fig:SynthAttack}) has a slow attack and release in which the
		in which the amplitudes increase and decrease more rapidly than that of the $f_{0}$. This signal also
		exhibits individual amplitude modulation of each of the harmonics. In the attack and decay portions of the
		piano signal (Figure \ref{fig:PianoAttack}) the amplitude ratios remain mostly consistent.

		Figure \ref{fig:SustainAmplitudes} shows the amplitude ratios between the harmonics and $f_{0}$ for the

		ratios in its sustain portion (Figure \ref{fig:CelloSustain}). The amplitude ratios in the sustain section
		of the synthesised signal oscillate about low levels apart from at one instance in which the amplitudes of
		the odd order harmonics exhibit high peaks. The clarinet and piano signals have more complex sustain
		sections in which the amplitudes of the individual harmonics vary greatly. In the clarinet signal (Figure
		\ref{fig:ClarinetSustain}) the harmonics amplitudes appear to change in unison with one another but
		independently from the $f_{0}$. In the piano signal's sustain section (Figure \ref{fig:PianoSustain}) at
		approximately 0.3 seconds the amplitude ratios for the 4\super{th}, 5\super{th} and 6\super{th} harmonics
		can be seen to rise rapidly and the 3\super{rd} harmonic begins to rise in level shortly afterwards. The
		damped $f_{0}$ in this signal is apparent, with several of the other harmonics having greater amplitudes.

		\end{figure}

		Figure \ref{fig:ReleaseAmplitudes} shows the amplitude ratios between the harmonics and $f_{0}$ for the
		release portions of the test signals. The synthesised signal is not included as it has an instantaneous
		release. Both the cello and clarinet signals (Figures \ref{fig:CelloRelease} and \ref{fig:ClarinetRelease})
		exhibit typical envelopes in their release sections, the amplitudes of the higher order harmonics decay
		more quickly than that of the $f_{0}$. In the cello signal however the 3\super{rd} harmonic is the most
		dominant being the last partial in the signal to decay fully. In the piano signal's release section (Figure
		\ref{fig:PianoRelease}) the 3\super{rd} harmonic is again very dominant but the damped $f_{0}$ must be
		taken into account when considering the relevance of this.

		The degree to which the relationships between the harmonics' amplitudes in a signal differ from those
		assumed by the reconstruction systems can be measured as the sum of the standard deviations of each of the
		harmonic amplitude ratios. This harmonic variability ($\mathrm{HV}$) is measured using Equation
		\ref{eq:HarmonicVariability}. 		
		
		\begin{gather}
			\mu_{n} = \frac{\sum_{f = 1}^{F} \frac{h_{n,f}}{h_{1,f}}}{F} \nonumber \\
			\sigma_{n} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{f = 1}^{F} 
					         \left(\frac{h_{n,f}}{h_{1,f}} - \mu_{n} \right)^{2}}{F}} \nonumber \\
			\mathrm{HV} = \sum_{n = 3}^{9} \sigma_{n}
			\label{eq:HarmonicVariability}
		\end{gather}

		Where $h_{n,f}$ is the amplitude of the $n$\super{th} harmonic in the $f$\super{th} frame of the STFT of
		the signal and $F$ the total number of frames in the STFT. Harmonic variability values for the four test
		signals used in this experiment are shown in Table \ref{tab:HarmonicVariabilities}.

		\begin{table}[h!]
			\centering
			\input{chapter7/Tables/HarmonicVariabilities.tex}
			\caption{The harmonic variabilities of the test signals.}
			\label{tab:HarmonicVariabilities}
		\end{table}

		The harmonic variability values provide a measure of how well the reconstruction systems should be able to
		reproduce the test signals. A higher harmonic variability describes a signal which will be less
		convincingly reconstructed. This is confirmed by measuring the correlation between the harmonic variability
		values and the mean scores given to stimuli reconstructed using a particular set of parameters in the
		multiple stimulus test. Correlation values for each of the reconstruction systems and parameter setting
		combinations are given in Table \ref{tab:HarmonicVariabilityCorrelations}. The stimulus numbers refer to
		the different reconstruction systems as in Figures \ref{fig:SMCRNonlin} and \ref{fig:SMCResults}.

		\begin{table}[h!]
			\centering
			\input{chapter7/Tables/HarmonicVariabilityCorrelations.tex}
			\caption{Correlations between the harmonic variabilities of the test signals and 
				 the mean grades given in the multiple stimulus test.}
			\label{tab:HarmonicVariabilityCorrelations}
		\end{table}

		These correlation values suggest that, for all but one of the reconstruction methods, the differences in
		the reconstruction quality between the test signals is due to the different relationships between their
		harmonics' amplitudes. For signals reconstructed using the synthesis method with a window length of 50
		samples (stimulus 2) the correlation between scores and harmonic variability is not so definitive. Another
		factor of the signals or system must influence the inaccuracies introduced when reconstructing in this
		manner. Inspecting the amplitude ratios of the harmonics in the reconstructed signals provides a possible
		explanation for this. The amplitudes ratios of the harmonics for the clarinet signal reconstructed using
		the synthesis technique are shown in Figure \ref{fig:STFTModulations}.

			\label{fig:STFTModulations}
		\end{figure}

		A window length of 50 samples does not provide the synthesis reconstruction system with enough spectral
		resolution to accurately track the amplitude envelope of the $f_{0}$. As a result the generated harmonics
		do not have a consistent amplitude relationship with the $f_{0}$ as seen in Figure
		\ref{fig:ClarinetSTFT50Sustain}. Figures \ref{fig:ClarinetSTFT100Sustain} and
		\ref{fig:ClarinetSTFT500Sustain} show that longer window lengths allow the amplitude envelope of the
		$f_{0}$ to be tracked more accurately, meaning the generated harmonics follow its amplitude envelope move
		consistently.
		
	\subsection{Conclusion}
	\label{sec:PerceptualExperiments-Reconstruction-Conclusion}
		It has been shown that the naturalness of harmonics generated using the information present in the $f_{0}$
		of a signal depends on both the method of generating the harmonic and the properties of the input signal.
		If sufficient processing is applied (increasing the STFT window length / filter order) all three of the
		tested harmonic generation methods perform similarly well. As the amount of processing is decreased
		(decreasing STFT window length / filter order) the synthesis method's performance decreases more rapidly
		than that of the SSBA and IAP based systems. For a given reconstruction system the amplitude envelopes of
		the harmonics in the input signal determine how easily it can be reconstructed. Signals in which the
		harmonics have amplitude envelopes which are linearly related to that of the $f_{0}$ are reconstructed with
		better quality than those with more complex relationships.
		
		The SSBA and IAP techniques also have the advantage of having lower computational complexity and introduce
		less latency. The synthesis method requires the calculation of the DFT and introduces latency equal to the
		window length used. Of the three tested methods IAP is the most suitable for use the harmonic excitation
		systems due to it being a positive homogeneous process. As discussed in Section
		\ref{sec:ExcitationEvaluation-Comparison-Homogeneity} this allows it to be applied to a wider range of
		signals with more predictable results.

\section{Semantic Control}
\label{sec:PerceptualExperiments-SemanticControl}
	\note
	{
		Why is this useful?
	}

	In this section the findings of Chapter \ref{chap:TimbreEvaluation} are combined with the techniques discussed in
	Chapter \ref{chap:FeatureControl} to develop audio effects with control parameters which relate to specific
	descriptive terms. Two effects are developed, each with a control parameter which changes alters the underlying
	processing based on three related semantic terms. The performance of these effects is evaluated both objectively,
	by comparison with the results discussed in Section \ref{sec:TimbreEvaluation-Analysis-TimbreSpaces}, and
	subjectively in a series of listening tests.

	\subsection{Effect Design}
	\label{sec:PerceptualExperiments-SemanticControl-EffectDesign}
		In this section the design of two harmonic excitation effects with control parameters intended to alter the
		perceived timbre of sounds between two of the descriptor groups identified in Chapter
		\ref{chap:TimbreEvaluation} is discussed. Across both the distortion and equaliser the thee descriptors
		with the highest agreements scores were `warm', `bright' and `crunch'. Two effects were designed, taking
		into account the timbral groups these descriptors belong to. The first effect, the warmth / brightness
		effect, is intended to alter timbre between the warmth and brightness groups, introducing `warmth' for low
		parameter values and `brightness' for higher parameter values. As `harsh' was shown to be a in the same
		timbral group as `bright' but being a more exaggerated version of it the highest parameter values should
		introduce `harshness'. The second effect, the brightness / crunchiness effect, is intended to alter timbre
		between the between `brightness' and `crunchiness' groups, introducing `crunchiness' for high parameter
		values and `brightness' for lower values. Again, due to `harsh' being a more exaggerated version of
		`bright' the lowest values should produce `harsher' timbres.

		\subsubsection*{Warmth / Brightness}
			The warmth / brightness effect controls the spectral centroid of a signal using a refined version
			of the system given in Figure \ref{fig:TwoBandSpectralCentroidSystem}. Two spectral bands are
			created, one with a spectral centroid lower than the input signal and one with a higher spectral
			centroid than the input signal. The relative levels of these bands is then adjusted in order to
			adjust the output's spectral centroid. The full system is shown in Figure \ref{fig:WarmHarsh}.

			The low frequency band is created by low pass filtering the input signal at its spectral centroid.
			The high frequency band is created by applying full wave rectification to the isolated $f_{0}$ of
			the input signal and high pass filtering at the input's spectral centroid.  Separating the bands at
			the spectral centroid in this way ensures that their respective spectral centroids sit either side
			of the input's. Full wave rectification is used to ensure the system is positive homogeneous.

			The semantic parameter controls the relative gains applied to each of the spectral bands. The
			parameter value, $p$, ranges from 0 to 1 and is used to calculate the gains, $m_{L}$ and $m_{H}$,
			applied to the low and high frequency bands using Equation \ref{eq:WarmHarshParam}.

			\begin{gather}
				m_{H} = p^{3} \nonumber \\
				m_{L} = 1 - m_{H}
				\label{eq:WarmHarshParam}
			\end{gather}

			When $p = 0$  the output is a low pass filtered version of the input signal resulting in a lower
			spectral centroid than the input. This corresponds to transforms  described as `warm' in the SAFE
			dataset. When $p = 1$ the output signal consists primarily of high order harmonics resulting in an
			increase in spectral centroid and corresponding to transforms labelled `harsh' in the SAFE dataset.
			The power to which $p$ is raised was determined experimentally such that when $p = 0.5$ the effect
			applies processing which corresponds to that described as `bright' in the SAFE dataset. 

		\subsubsection*{Brightness / Crunchiness}
			In Chapter \ref{chap:TimbreEvaluation} we show that `crunchiness' is associated with a small
			increase in spectral irregularity and an output signal with a low spectral kurtosis and spectral
			skewness. To recreate this the brightness / crunchiness effect controls the spectral irregularity
			of a signal along with the proportion of high frequency energy introduced.  The system is based on
			that described in Figure \ref{fig:SpectralShapingSystem}. The full system is shown in Figure
			\ref{fig:HarshCrunch}.

			Each of the individual harmonics are generated using the IAP technique discussed in Section
			\ref{sec:Excitation-Methods-IAP}. This method was chosen due to it performing the best in the
			experiments in Section \ref{sec:PerceptualExperiments-Reconstruction}. To reduce computational load
			the filter used to isolate the $f_{0}$ in this system is a second order IIR low pass filter.  The
			use of a low order filter means that there is a higher proportion of high frequency energy which
			remains in the isolated $f_{0}$. This in turn produces more intermodulation components in the
			generated harmonics. Each of the generated harmonics is band pass filtered in order to reduce the
			influence of these intermodulation components. For higher order harmonics this band pass filtering
			is not effective so only the first six harmonics are generated individually. Again a high frequency
			spectral band is generated by full wave rectifying the isolated $f_{0}$. This high frequency band
			is high pass filtered at the frequency of the sixth harmonic so as not to interfere with the
			individually generated harmonics.

			The effect has one control parameter which ranges from 0 to 1 and controls the relative amplitudes
			of regions of the output spectrum. The spectral irregularity is controlled by adjusting the
			relative levels of the first six harmonics. The analysis and resynthesis technique discussed in
			Section \ref{sec:FeatureControl-Parameterisation-Irregularity} proved to complex to run accurately
			in real time. In its place a simpler system based on a predefined set of harmonic amplitudes,
			$c$, was used. The relative amplitudes of the harmonics are altered as the parameter value, $p$,
			is changed according to Equation \ref{eq:HarshCrunchAmps}.

			\begin{equation}
				a_{n} = p(c_{n} - 1) + 1
				\label{eq:HarshCrunchAmps}
			\end{equation}

			When $p = 0$ the first six harmonics all have the same amplitude, giving the lowest spectral
			irregularity. When $p = 1$ the relative amplitudes of the first six harmonics are as defined by
			$c$.  The values in $c$ are taken from a guitar signal, which had been processed by the SAFE
			distortion, with a Krimphoff irregularity similar to the processed signals in the SAFE dataset
			described as `crunchy'. As the parameter value is increased the spectral irregularity of the first
			six harmonics increases towards that of a `crunchy' signal. This models the increase in spectral
			irregularity noted for the transforms labelled `crunchy' in Chapter \ref{chap:TimbreEvaluation}.
			
			The relative amount of high frequency content in the output is also controlled by $p$. This is
			achieved by changing the relative level of the first six harmonics and the band generated by the
			full wave rectifier. The final gains applied to the six generated harmonics along with that applied
			to the rectifier output are given by Equation \ref{eq:HarshCrunchParam}.

			\begin{gather}
				m_{n} = a_{n}\frac{3p + 2}{4} \nonumber \\
				m_{H} = \frac{8 - 7p}{5}
				\label{eq:HarshCrunchParam}
			\end{gather}

			The constants used here were derived experimentally such that when $p = 1$ the amount of energy in
			the high and low bands of the spectrum are roughly equal for a range of input signals. This
			produces the low spectral kurtosis and spectral skewness noticed in signals labeled `crunchy' in
			the SAFE dataset. Lower values of $p$ increase the levels of high frequency energy in the output
			signal causing the spectral transformations associated with `bright' and then `harsh' signals.

	\subsection{Methodology}
	\label{sec:PerceptualExperiments-SemanticControl-Methodology}
		The performance of each effect is evaluated using a set of ten test signals, comprising two electric bass
		guitars (B1 and B2), a flute (F), two electric guitars (G1 and G2), a marimba (M), an oboe (O), a saxophone
		(S), a trumpet (T) and a violin (V). The signals were adjusted to have equal loudness prior to
		experimentation.  Firstly the effects are evaluated objectively by comparing them to the analysis performed
		in Chapter \ref{chap:TimbreEvaluation}. Secondly the effects are evaluated subjectively in a series of
		perceptual listening tests.

		\subsubsection*{Objective Evaluation}
			The performance of each effect is evaluated objectively by examining how they manipulate the
			features of the test signals. Each effect is used to process each of the test signals with its
			parameter set to the minimum value, the middle value and the maximum value, corresponding to
			`warm', `bright' and `harsh' for the warmth / brightness effect and `harsh', `bright' and `crunchy'
			for the brightness / crunchiness effect. The audio features of the unprocessed and processed
			signals in each of these applications are calculated in the same manner as in the SAFE plug-ins.
			These audio features are the compared to those taken from the SAFE dataset.

			As discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:TimbreEvaluation} the terms `warm', `harsh' and `bright' are all
			used to describe transformations applied by both distortion and equalisation effects. `Harsh' and
			`bright' having different definitions depending on the type of processing applied. The objective
			performance of the effects proposed in this section is evaluated against data from both the SAFE
			distortion and equaliser. In order to be able to compare the different effects timbre spaces, two
			new timbre spaces are constructed by performing PCA on the processed audio features and feature
			differences of the combined distortion and equaliser data. Two performance scores are given to each
			combination of audio effect, descriptor and test signal. The first measuring how close the
			processed features of the signal are to points labelled with the descriptor in the processed
			feature timbre space.  The second measuring how close the changes in features caused by the effect
			are to points labelled with the descriptor in the feature difference timbre space.

			The performance of a particular effect, for a given combination of parameter setting and test
			signal is measured by projecting the extracted audio features to a point on the relevant timbre
			space. The processed features of the signal are projected onto the processed feature timbre space
			and the feature differences onto the feature difference timbre space. The Mahalanobis distance,
			$M(x, d)$, between this point, $x$, and the distribution of transforms labelled with the
			descriptor, $d$, is taken using Equation \ref{eq:Mahalanobis}
			
			\begin{equation}
				M(x, d) = \sqrt{(x - \mu_{d})^{T}\Sigma_{d}^{-1}(x - \mu_{d})}
				\label{eq:Mahalanobis}
			\end{equation}

			Where $x$ is a column vector containing the coordinates of the point in the timbre space, $\mu_{d}$
			a column vector containing the mean coordinates of all transforms in the timbre space labelled with
			descriptor $d$ and $\Sigma_{d}$ the covariance matrix of those transforms' coordinates in the
			timbre space. The number of coordinates used in the calculation of Mahalanobis distance is
			determined in the same manner as in Section \ref{sec:TimbreEvaluation-Analysis-Agreement}. Where
			there are more than five transforms in the distribution, the coordinates in the first five PCs of
			the timbre space are used. Where the number of points in the distribution, $N_{d}$, is lower, only
			the first $N_{d} - 1$ coordinates can be used in order to avoid $\Sigma_{d}$ being singular. Where
			the descriptor, $d$, is represented by two distributions of transforms, one from the distortion and
			one from the equaliser, the Mahalanobis distance from both distributions is taken and the minimum
			distance kept as the measure of performance.
	
		\subsubsection*{Subjective Evaluation}
			To assess the performance of the developed effects subjectively a series of perceptual listening
			tests were undertaken. For the purpose of testing, each of the effects was implemented as an audio
			plug-in. Participants were presented with a DAW session containing a track for each of the test
			signals. On each track both effect plug-ins were inserted. The effects were labelled as ``Plug-In
			1'' and ``Plug-In 2'' and had identical interfaces as seen in Figure \ref{fig:TestPlugInterface}.

			\begin{figure}[h!]
				\centering
				\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{chapter7/Images/TestPlugInInterface.png}
				\caption{The interface used for assessing the performance of the developed effects.}
				\label{fig:TestPlugInterface}
			\end{figure}

			To mitigate influence of the plug-in's interface layout on the result of the experiment the
			direction of the parameter sliders was randomised for each participant. The order of the tracks in
			the DAW session was also randomised to mitigate any effect the order of tracks may have on results.

			For each effect, on each signal, participants were asked to first take a short time to audition the
			effect to become accustomed to how changing the parameter value affects that particular input
			signal. Once they had investigated the operation of the effect, they were asked to label the
			parameter slider at three positions (parameter values of 0, 0.5 and 1) with a term they felt best
			described the timbral effect of the effect at that parameter setting. A list of available terms was
			provided in a drop down list at each parameter value to be labelled as seen in Figure
			\ref{fig:TestPlugInterface}. The available terms were the 17 unique terms from the SAFE dataset
			discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:TimbreEvaluation} (airy, boomy, boxy, bright, clear, creamy,
			crunchy, deep, full, fuzzy, harsh, muddy, raspy, smooth, thin, tinny and warm).

			For each combination of signal, effect and parameter position there is an intended descriptor
			(those that the effects were designed to elicit) and a descriptor provided by the participant. The
			relationships between these responses are assessed in two ways. Firstly, participant's responses
			are compared against the clustering performed in Section
			\ref{sec:TimbreEvaluation-Analysis-TermClustering}. The dendrograms shown in Figure
			\ref{fig:CombinedClusters} provide information about how similar the signals / transforms described
			by certain terms are. This information can be used as a metric describing the proximity of the
			user's response to the intended response. The proximity of two descriptors is measured as the
			cophenetic distance between the clusters in which the two descriptors lie. Where a descriptor
			appears twice in the dendrogram (from both the distortion and equaliser) the combination of points
			which yield the lowest cophenetic distance is used. Secondly, heat maps are plotted comparing the
			usage of the 17 available descriptors against the intended descriptors.

			Listening tests were undertaken using circumaural headphones in a quiet listening environment. In
			total 22 participants took part in the listening tests, all of whom reported no know hearing
			problems. On average participants took 25 minutes to complete the test.

	\subsection{Results}

		\subsubsection{Mahalanobis Distances}
			The Mahalanobis distances between the test signals after being processed by the warmth / brightness
			effect and those in the timbre space constructed from the SAFE dataset are shown in Figure
			\ref{fig:HarshJeffs}. Distances in both the processed feature space and the feature difference
			space are shown in Figures \ref{fig:HarshProcJeff} and \ref{fig:HarshDiffJeff} respectively.

	\subsection{Discussion}
	\label{sec:PerceptualExperiments-SemanticControl-Discussion}
		\subsubsection*{Warmth / Brightness Effect}
			It was determined in Chapter \ref{chap:TimbreEvaluation} that the descriptors `warm', `bright' and
			`harsh' are best defined by relative changes in audio features rather than absolute values of
			features in the output signal. `Warmth' describing transforms which shift spectral energy towards
			lower frequencies and `brightness' and `harshness' describing transforms which introduce increasing
			proportions of high frequency energy. Because of this, distances measured in the processed feature
			space (Figures \ref{fig:HarshProcJeff} and \ref{fig:HarshProcCoph}) do not give as good a measure
			of performance as those in the feature difference space (Figure \ref{fig:HarshDiffJeff} and
			\ref{fig:HarshDiffCoph}).

			The results in Figure \ref{fig:HarshDiffJeff} imply that the warmth / brightness effect is
			successful in applying transforms similar to those described as `warm' and `bright' in the SAFE
			dataset. For the majority of the input signals the Mahalanobis distances for the `warm' and
			`bright' transforms are close to 1, indicating that the transform fits well within the distribution
			of other transforms labeled with these descriptors in the timbre space.
			
			When attempting to make the test signals `harsher' however, the effect does not perform well on the
			bass guitar, flute, marimba or oboe signals. This is likely due to the small number of transforms
			labelled harsh in the timbre space. In Chapter \ref{chap:TimbreEvaluation} `harsh' was given a low
			agreement score in both the distortion and equaliser timbre spaces due to there only being four
			transforms labeled `harsh' in each space. As such, only a small region of the timbre space is
			described as harsh, making it more difficult to design a transform which will sit in that region
			for a wide range of input signals.
			
			Examining the mean cophenetic distances in Figure \ref{fig:HarshDiffCoph} it might appear that
			while listening test participants do not always use the terms which the warmth / brightness effect
			was designed to elicit, on average they use terms which lie in the same cluster. Referring to
			Figure \ref{fig:CombinedDifferenceClusters} we find three main clusters, which could be described
			as `warmth' (containing the terms `mud', `boom', `smooth', `crunch', `full', `deep', `warm' and
			`cream'), `distorted brightness' (containing the terms `fuzz', `bright', `harsh', `box' and `rasp')
			and `equalised brightness' (containing the terms 'clear', `bright', `tin', `thin', `air' and
			`harsh'). These three clusters have heights of 17.3, 13.5 and 16.5 respectively. The mean
			cophenetic for each of the test signals all lie close to or below these cluster heights. Further
			analysis is required to determine whether this indicates that participants are using terms in the
			relevant clusters.

			Figure \ref{fig:HarshConfusion} shows that `warm' was the most commonly used term when describing
			the effect of the warmth / brightness effect when its parameter is set to `warm', followed by
			`clear', `box' and `mud'. These descriptors lie across all three of the clusters identified in
			Figure \ref{fig:CombinedDifferenceClusters}. Summing the cells of this figure shows that
			participants only used descriptors in the same cluster as `warm' 54\% of the time. The mean
			cophenetic distances for the `warm' transform in Figure \ref{fig:HarshDiffCoph} do not represent
			participants using descriptors from the correct cluster. The failure of the effect to elicit terms
			related to warmth from participants may indicate that warmth is not only defined by a shift in
			spectral energy towards lower frequencies. Examining figure \ref{fig:HarshProcJeff} it is seen
			that, for approximately half the test signals, the processed signals are significantly distant from
			the region described as `warm' in the processed feature space constructed from the SAFE dataset.
			
			Considering only the changes in audio features described by transforms, the terms `bright' and
			`harsh' seem to have different definitions depending on the type of processing applied, as seen in
			Chapter \ref{chap:TimbreEvaluation}. The results of this listening test, however, suggest that
			these terms may be more closely related. The differences in their clustering being due only to the
			differences in processing rather than differences in perception. Figure \ref{fig:HarshConfusion}
			shows that, when describing the effect of the warmth / brightness effect, participants selected a
			term related to the intended descriptor 74\% of the time for `bright' and 80\% of the time for
			`harsh'. The terms they selected come from both the `distorted brightness' and `equalised
			brightness' clusters, suggesting that although some of these terms were gathered using the SAFE
			Equaliser they can still be applied to distortion type effects. Regardless of this, the most
			commonly used descriptors, `fuzz', `harsh' and `rasp' all lie within the `distorted brightness'
			cluster. The use of terms which were collected from the SAFE equaliser may be explained by the
			anonymity of the effects in this test. While using the SAFE plug-ins the user is aware of the type
			of effect they are using so may be more likely to use descriptors they associate with that effect.
			In this test the type of effect is not know to the user so they may select descriptors they would
			not usually associate with the type of effect being used.

			The listening test data does not represent a difference between `bright' and `harsh' as seen in
			Chapter \ref{chap:TimbreEvaluation}. Both the `bright' and `harsh' positions of the warmth /
			brightness effect's parameter were labelled as `fuzzy' the most often. The `harsh' position was
			labelled as `harsh' more often than the `bright' position, suggesting that the `harsh' position on
			the slider produces `harsher' transforms than the `bright' position, but not that `harsh' does not
			apply when describing signals processed with the parameter set to the `bright' position.
			
		\subsubsection*{Brightness / Crunchiness Effect}
			In Chapter \ref{chap:TimbreEvaluation} it was concluded that `crunchiness' is defined by an output
			signal with energy spread evenly throughout the spectrum and a slight increase in spectral
			irregularity. This means that, when attempting to make signals sound `crunchier', both the
			processed features and feature differences are relevant.  Figure \ref{fig:CrunchProcJeff} shows
			that for the majority of the input signals the brightness / crunchiness effect produces output
			signals which are close to those labeled as `crunchy' in the SAFE dataset. However, the transforms
			applied to produce these signals are less similar to those in the SAFE dataset, as seen in Figure
			\ref{fig:CrunchDiffJeff}. This is possibly explained by the simplifications made to reduce the
			effect's computational complexity. Using lower order filters increases the level of intermodulation
			components in the individually generated harmonics. Controlling the relative levels of these
			generated harmonics no longer has the expected effect on spectral irregularity as each generated
			harmonic contains several spectral partials with unknown amplitudes.

			For the brightness / crunchiness effect's `bright' and `harsh' parameter settings only the measures
			of Mahalanobis distance in the feature difference space are relevant (is in the analysis of the
			warmth / brightness effect). In this regard the effect is most accurate in recreating transforms
			labelled `bright' in the SAFE dataset, having similar performance to the warmth / brightness
			effect.  For its `harsh' parameter setting it is less accurate, again possibly due to the low
			confidence definition of the term `harsh' due to it being used with very low frequency in the SAFE
			dataset.

			In Figure \ref{fig:CombinedClusters} the term `crunch' sits in different clusters depending on the
			features used for clustering. When using the processed features it sits alongside `tin', `harsh',
			`full', `thin', `air' and `clear', whereas using the feature differences it is part of the `warmth'
			cluster described previously. Examining the mean cophenetic distances from the listening test
			(Figure \ref{fig:CrunchCophs}) it appears that participants used terms which cluster closer to
			`crunch' in the feature difference space when labelling the brightness / crunchiness effect's
			`crunch' parameter position. Summing the relevant cells in the heat map shown in Figure
			\ref{fig:CrunchConfusion} is is seen that using the clusters calculated from processed features,
			participants only used terms in the same cluster as `crunch' 17\% of the time. Whereas when using
			the feature difference this figure rises to 51\%. This might suggest that `crunch' is better
			defined by properties of the transform rather than of the output signal.

			The performance of the brightness / crunchiness effect in its `bright' and `harsh' parameter
			settings is similar to that of the warmth / brightness effect. The mean cophenetic distances in the
			feature difference space (Figure \ref{fig:CrunchDiffCoph}) are low, suggesting that participants
			are selecting descriptors in the relevant clusters. Referring to the heat map in Figure
			\ref{fig:CrunchConfusion} it is seen that a descriptor from a relevant cluster is used 72\% of the
			time for the `bright' parameter setting and 90\% of the time for the `harsh' parameter setting.
			Both the warmth / brightness and brightness / crunchiness effects behave similarly in their
			`bright' and `harsh' parameter parameter settings, introducing a high pass filtered version of the
			full wave rectified $f_{0}$. Again `fuzz' is the most commonly used descriptor for both parameter
			settings.

		\subsubsection*{Descriptor Clustering}
			The results of the listening test can be further analysed by clustering terms based on how often
			they were used to describe particular a particular combination of signal, effect and parameter
			setting. This clustering can be used to identify synonyms and compare them with the timbral groups
			identified in Chapter \ref{chap:TimbreEvaluation}. Dendrograms of this clustering are shown on the
			heat maps in Figures \ref{fig:HarshConfusion}, \ref{fig:CrunchConfusion} and
			\ref{fig:CombConfusion}.

			Across all three heat maps the terms group into two main clusters. A `fuzziness' cluster
			(containing terms such as `fuzz', `rasp', `crunch' and `harsh') and a `warmth' cluster (containing
			terms such as `warm', `mud', `full' and `cream'). This can be seen as a lower resolution version of
			the clustering performed in Chapter \ref{chap:TimbreEvaluation} combining the warmth and muddiness
			clusters and the brightness and crunchiness clusters. The two clusters identified represent
			transforms which introduce a larger proportion of high frequency energy and those which introduce a
			larger proportion of lower frequency energy.

	\subsection{Conclusion}
	\label{sec:PerceptualExperiments-SemanticControl-Conclusion}
		This experiment has shown that, using information collected from the SAFE data and the harmonic excitation
		systems developed in Chapter \ref{chap:FeatureControl}, harmonic excitation can be easily used to introduce
		brightness and harshness to an audio signal while crunchiness is a more timbral adjective to isolate.

		Both the warmth / brightness and brightness / crunchiness effects are successful in producing effect which
		are described as `bright' and `harsh' by isolating the $f_{0}$, applying full wave rectification and high
		pass filtering. `Hash' is confirmed to be a more exaggerated version of `bright', describing signals with
		higher proportions of high frequency content. Due to the nature of the processing however, other terms are
		also used to describe these effects such as `fuzzy' and `raspy'. These terms were associated with the SAFE
		distortion effect in Chapter \ref{chap:TimbreEvaluation}, and so we expect that they may get used to
		describe a harmonic excitation system.

		The results of the listening test with the warmth / brightness effect show that applying a low pass filter
		with a cutoff frequency at the input's spectral centroid is not sufficient to produce a `warmer' sound.
		Further analysis of the input signal may be necessary in order to ensure the resulting output is `warmer'
		than it, ensuring that the low pass filter will give the correct proportion of low and high frequency
		energy in the output. Crunchiness is also difficult to achieve despite being well defined in the timbre
		spaces shown in Chapter \ref{chap:TimbreEvaluation}, where the `crunchy' and `warm' regions have an overlap
		suggesting that there may be other factors which could be used by audio effects to better differentiate the
		two.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:PerceptualExperiments-Summary}
	% It all works, it's fine, don't worry about it, leave me alone.
	The two experiments discussed in this chapter have illustrated the effectiveness of the developed harmonic
	excitation systems in performing common audio production tasks. 
	
	The systems shown in Figure \ref{fig:InharmonicitySystem} provide individual control over the amplitude and
	frequency of individual partials in the output signal. With knowledge of how the system is operated this can be
	used for the reconstruction of the fine spectral structure of degraded signals. As seen in Section
	\ref{sec:PerceptualExperiments-Reconstruction}, when using a suitable harmonic generation method and sufficiently
	selective filters these systems can produce reconstructions which are objectively similar to the non-degraded
	signal and also perform well in subjective listening tests. One disadvantage of these systems is their reliance on
	using the amplitude envelope of the $f_{0}$ in the reconstruction of harmonics. It has been shown that the degree
	to which the amplitude envelopes of the harmonics in a signal differ from that of the $f_{0}$ dictates the
	perceived quality of a reconstruction using these systems. If prior information is known about the relationships
	between the harmonics in the signal being reconstructed the quality of the reconstruction could be improved by
	selecting different harmonics to base the reconstructed amplitude envelopes on.

	The parameters of these systems (individual harmonic gain and frequency shifts) can be mapped onto higher lever
	`perceptual control' parameters which control particular audio features of a signal. The mappings between perceived
	timbral features and lower level features can informed by semantically annotated audio production data such as that
	gathered by the SAFE plug-ins. A harmonic excitation system can then be configured to control the relevant audio
	features using the techniques discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:FeatureControl}. Using this approach it has been shown
	that harmonic excitation systems can be successfully configured to control brightness and harshness in audio
	signals. The developed effects were less successful in introducing warmth and crunchiness to test signals. More
	complex parameter mappings, with multiple control parameters may allow for better timbral expressiveness. The
	timbre spaces constructed from the SAFE dataset could also be used as a control system through use of the two
	dimensional slider interface, similar to work by \citet{schwarz2007corpus} or \citet{stasis2015a}.
